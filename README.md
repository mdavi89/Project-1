## Description

   We wanted a way for people to help keep track of their spending. We built this for people who need a better way to layout their budget, expenses, and spending. It allows the user to see their budget, current expenses, and remaining budget all in one place. We learned how to collaborate with each other and got familiar with putting all our learned practices into one website. We learned how to properly use collaborate our code using github.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
Add a budget in the budget
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
